Comprehensive Feature Set for a Swing Trading Algorithm
Swing trading (with 5–10 day holding periods) can leverage a wide array of data features to predict winning trades. Below is a categorized list of technical, fundamental, sentiment, macroeconomic, market structure, and alternative features. For each category, we outline specific features, why they’re useful, and how they help maximize gains or minimize risk. Finally, we discuss how to combine these features in a hybrid rule-based + ML strategy.
Technical Indicators and Price/Volume Features
Technical features derive from historical price and volume data. They help identify trends, momentum, volatility, and entry/exit points critical for short-term trades. These features aim to capture market psychology and timing, maximizing profit potential while managing downside risk

:
Trend-Following Indicators: Moving averages (e.g. 5-day, 10-day, 50-day SMA/EMA) and trend strength metrics like ADX or Ichimoku Cloud. These indicate the prevailing price trend (up or down) and its strength
medium.com
. Rationale: Trading with the trend can maximize gains by riding sustained moves, and filters (like price above a 50-day MA) can reduce risk by avoiding counter-trend trades.
Momentum Oscillators: Indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Stochastics, and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). These measure the speed and magnitude of price moves
investopedia.com
academy.ftmo.com
. Rationale: Oscillators highlight overbought or oversold conditions (e.g. RSI > 70 or < 30), helping time entries/exits – e.g. taking profits before a reversal or avoiding entries when a swing is overextended
medium.com
. This minimizes risk of buying into a peak or selling into a trough.
Volatility Metrics: Average True Range (ATR), Bollinger Bands, historical price standard deviation, etc. These gauge how much price swings and whether volatility is rising or falling
medium.com
. Rationale: Higher ATR or wide Bollinger Bands indicate a volatile stock (higher potential reward and risk). Volatility measures can inform position sizing and stop-loss levels – e.g. using a multiple of ATR for stop distance to avoid being shaken out, or skipping trades where volatility is too extreme for comfort (risk control).
Volume and Liquidity Indicators: Daily volume, volume moving averages, relative volume (current volume vs. average), On-Balance Volume (OBV), and Accumulation/Distribution line. Unusual volume spikes or increasing OBV can signal strong participation in a move (institutional buying or selling). Rationale: Volume confirms price movements – a rally on high volume is more likely to continue (maximize gain) than one on low volume. Relative volume filters can be a rule (e.g. trade only if volume is 150% of normal) to ensure sufficient liquidity and interest. High liquidity also minimizes slippage risk when entering/exiting trades.
Support/Resistance Levels: Key price levels from charts – e.g. previous swing highs/lows, pivot points, or Fibonacci retracement levels. Stocks often stall or reverse at these levels due to clustered buy/sell orders. Rationale: Entering near support (with a stop just below) provides a favorable risk/reward (limited downside if support holds, significant upside if price rebounds). Likewise, recognizing resistance helps set profit targets to exit before an upswing loses momentum
investopedia.com
. This feature set maximizes gains by capturing reversals and minimizes risk by defining clear exit points.
Price Patterns and Signals: Technical chart patterns (flags, head-and-shoulders, double bottom/top, etc.) and candlestick patterns (doji, engulfing, hammer). These patterns often precede short-term trend changes. Rationale: A rule-based component might scan for bullish patterns (e.g. an engulfing candle at support or a breakout from a flag) to trigger a trade setup. Such patterns distilled into features (e.g. a boolean indicating a particular pattern presence) can improve the ML model’s context. This helps maximize gains by catching known high-probability setups and controls risk by avoiding ambiguous price action.
How technical features aid gains/risk: Technical indicators are primary tools for swing traders to time entries and exits
investopedia.com
. Trend and momentum features help identify when a stock is moving strongly (so one can ride the wave for profits) or when it’s overextended (to avoid chasing or to take profit). Volatility and volume features measure risk – a sudden volatility spike might signal event risk (caution) or a breakout opportunity
medium.com
. By systematically using technical signals (e.g. EMA trend direction, RSI thresholds), the algorithm can maximize gains through momentum plays and minimize risk by avoiding trades during unfavorable technical conditions (like low-volume breakouts or highly volatile whipsaws).
Fundamental Features
Fundamental features relate to a company’s financial health, valuation, and corporate actions. While swing trading is short-term, fundamentals can serve as filters for quality and highlight upcoming catalysts or risks. Strong fundamentals can provide a margin of safety (limiting downside), and certain fundamental events can trigger swings in the 5–10 day window:
Valuation Metrics: Ratios like Price-to-Earnings (P/E), Price-to-Book (P/B), Price/Earnings-to-Growth (PEG), and EV/EBITDA. These indicate whether a stock is potentially overvalued or undervalued relative to peers or history
money-mentor.org
. Rationale: In a hybrid strategy, one might filter out extremely overpriced stocks (to avoid downside risk if the market corrects their overvaluation) or target moderately undervalued stocks that have room to run. While valuation alone may not predict a 1-week move, it contributes to risk management – an overvalued stock may be riskier to hold if sentiment sours, whereas an undervalued stock with momentum might have more upside.
Earnings and Revenue Growth: Metrics such as quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year earnings growth, revenue growth, and profit margins. Consistent growth and high margins signal a strong business. Rationale: Strong earnings trends can attract swing traders after a pullback, on the premise that fundamentally solid companies will recover (minimizing risk of a trade failing). Additionally, earnings surprises (actual results vs. analyst estimates) are crucial short-term catalysts
money-mentor.org
. A positive surprise often leads to a sharp price jump, while a miss can tank the stock – so features capturing the magnitude of last earnings surprise or earnings momentum help the model anticipate post-earnings swings. (A rule-based approach might avoid opening new positions right before earnings to minimize gap risk, or conversely, specifically seek post-earnings setups.)
Financial Strength: Debt-to-Equity ratio, current ratio, cash flow, and other balance sheet metrics. For example, high debt levels can pose risk, whereas strong free cash flow and low debt indicate stability
money-mentor.org
money-mentor.org
. Rationale: Stocks of financially healthy companies tend to be less prone to sudden collapse (minimizing catastrophic risk). A swing trade in a low-debt, cash-rich company is safer in that bad news is less likely to trigger insolvency fears. This doesn’t usually change in 10 days, but as a filter it improves the quality of picks (maximizing the chance that a dip will be bought by investors, for instance).
Dividend Yield and Policy: Dividend-paying stocks with a consistent or growing dividend. A feature can be the dividend yield or upcoming ex-dividend date. Rationale: Dividend yield provides a cushion – yield-supported stocks may have limited downside as investors buy dips for income. However, around ex-dividend dates, short-term price patterns (price drops by roughly the dividend amount) can occur; the algorithm might adjust for this or use it as a timing consideration (e.g. entering after an ex-dividend dip if other signals are bullish). Dividends also attract longer-term buyers, potentially stabilizing the price (lower risk).
Industry and Sector Factors: Industry-specific fundamentals or sector health metrics. For example, sector performance features (how the stock’s sector index or ETF has performed recently)
medium.com
, or industry indicators (oil prices for oil stocks, semiconductor demand indices for chip stocks, etc.). Rationale: Even a strong stock can struggle if its industry is facing headwinds (and vice versa). Including sector trends or industry-specific data (like auto sales figures for an auto stock) helps the model account for broader fundamental currents that can influence 5–10 day moves. This maximizes gains by aligning trades with industries in favor (a rising sector lifts its stocks) and minimizes risk by avoiding sectors in fundamental turmoil.
Analyst Sentiment and Institutional Activity: Features such as the number of recent analyst upgrades/downgrades, changes in price targets, or consensus rating. Also, institutional holdings or recent changes (e.g. if regulatory filings show hedge funds buying). Rationale: An upgrade or positive analyst commentary can spark short-term rallies; similarly, news of a prominent fund taking a stake can boost a stock. These events reflect fundamental outlook changes. By including analyst sentiment, the model can capture shifts in market expectations. As a rule-based filter, one might avoid stocks with predominantly negative or deteriorating analyst outlooks to reduce risk.
Earnings Calendar Events: The proximity of key events like earnings releases, product launches, or investor days. A binary feature for “earnings due in next N days” is useful. Rationale: Stocks often get volatile around earnings – which is double-edged. To minimize risk, many swing traders avoid holding through an earnings announcement (due to gap risk). The algorithm’s rule-based part can exclude trades that would span an earnings date. Conversely, post-earnings drift is a phenomenon where a positive surprise leads to continued upward drift for days; the ML model could exploit this by favoring stocks that had strong surprises and initial gap up
money-mentor.org
. Being aware of such events maximizes gain (if used opportunistically) or avoids unpredictable risk (if filtered out).
Insider Activity: (Bridging to alternative data) Significant insider buying or selling, reported via SEC filings. Insiders (executives, directors) buying their own stock can be a bullish fundamental signal of undervaluation. Rationale: Cluster buys (multiple insiders buying at once) are “the strongest signal you can get” from insider trading – indicating insiders collectively expect the stock to rise
nasdaq.com
nasdaq.com
. As a feature, recent insider buying activity could tilt the model to a more bullish prediction (maximizing gain potential), while heavy insider selling might be a caution flag. (Insider trades are often used as a confirmation in a rule-based strategy – e.g. only swing trade stocks where insiders are net buyers, to align with those who know the company best.)
How fundamental features aid gains/risk: Fundamental filters ensure the algorithm picks quality setups. For example, focusing on companies with strong earnings growth and reasonable valuations means selected stocks are fundamentally sound – improving the odds that a price pullback is just temporary and will swing back up (thus protecting downside)
money-mentor.org
money-mentor.org
. Fundamental catalysts like earnings or product news can be sources of large short-term moves; by modeling these, the algorithm can capture upside from catalysts (maximizing gains) or avoid trades before adverse events (minimizing risk). In essence, fundamentals add a “safety net” and context behind price action – they help differentiate a genuine opportunity from a value trap or hype.
Sentiment and News Features
Sentiment features gauge the mood and opinions of market participants, derived from news, social media, and other textual data. Since swing trading profits from short-term price movement, understanding sentiment is key – bullish sentiment can propel a stock upward, while bearish sentiment can foretell declines. Including sentiment helps the algorithm anticipate or confirm moves that technicals alone might miss
medium.com
.
News Sentiment Score: Quantified sentiment from recent news articles and press releases about the company. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP), news can be scored as positive, negative, or neutral
medium.com
. Rationale: A stream of upbeat news (e.g. contract wins, favorable product reviews) often drives stock prices higher in the short term. Conversely, negative news (legal issues, recalls) can drag a stock down. A feature could be the aggregated sentiment over the past week or the tone of the most recent impactful news. This helps maximize gains by identifying stocks with building positive narratives, and minimize risk by flagging negative news sentiment early (to avoid or short such stocks).
Social Media Sentiment and Buzz: Data from Twitter, StockTwits, Reddit (WallStreetBets, etc.), or Yahoo Finance message boards indicating retail investor sentiment. This can include sentiment score (positive vs negative mentions) and mention volume (how frequently the stock is talked about). Rationale: Viral popularity or hype on social platforms can lead to rapid price gains (as seen in meme-stock rallies). A sudden surge in mentions might precede a price spike, making it a powerful predictive feature. However, extreme hype can also signal a top (e.g. if sentiment is euphorically bullish, the stock may be overbought). By monitoring social sentiment, the algorithm can ride positive waves (maximizing profit) but also gauge when sentiment might be overextended (to control risk or tighten stops).
Analyst and Expert Sentiment: This overlaps fundamental and sentiment – for example, the tone of analyst reports or expert blogs. A simple feature is the consensus rating (buy/hold/sell) or recent changes in that consensus. Rationale: Improving sentiment among professionals (say, several analysts raising targets) can give a short-term boost as more investors notice the stock. It contributes to confidence in a trade (lower risk of negative surprises). This is often used in tandem with technicals – e.g. a rule might be “consider long trade only if technicals are bullish and analyst sentiment is not deteriorating”.
Market Sentiment Indicators: Broad sentiment indices like the Fear & Greed Index or put/call ratios. For individual stocks, the options put/call ratio or skew can indicate sentiment of options traders (high call volume implies bullish bets). Rationale: If a stock’s option activity shows unusually high call buying, it may suggest optimism for a near-term rally. On the other hand, a spike in put buying could mean traders hedging (bearish sentiment) – which could foreshadow a drop or, contrarily, set the stage for a contrarian bounce if overdone. These features tie into risk: e.g. extremely low put/call (everyone bullish) might caution that the trade is crowded (risk of reversal), whereas moderate optimism could support an ongoing swing up.
Sentiment Momentum: The change in sentiment over time. For example, whether news sentiment is improving or worsening week-over-week, or if social media buzz is growing or fading. Rationale: The direction of sentiment change often matters. A stock shifting from negative to neutral/positive sentiment can indicate a bottoming out and start of an upswing (maximize gain by getting in early). Conversely, if sentiment was very positive but now turning negative (perhaps due to a scandal or disappointment), the swing trader may avoid longs or even short the stock (minimizing the risk of holding a suddenly unfavorable stock).
Event Sentiment (Contextual): Sentiment around specific events – e.g. an earnings call transcript sentiment (detecting if management’s tone was confident or cautious), or social sentiment specifically on product launches, etc. Rationale: This granular sentiment can be a leading indicator. For instance, if an earnings call is optimistic (positive tone and keywords), the stock might rally in subsequent days as investors digest the news. Including such features can give the ML model an edge in forecasting post-event drift.
How sentiment features aid gains/risk: Sentiment is often a short-term driver of price changes – markets are moved as much by emotions and expectations as by facts. By quantifying crowd psychology, the algorithm can anticipate moves that pure fundamentals or even technicals might not capture. For example, a stock might be fundamentally mediocre but experience a social media hype wave that technical indicators haven’t yet reflected; a sentiment feature would catch that, allowing a timely trade to maximize profit. Likewise, negative sentiment can warn of potential breakdowns even if a chart looks fine, helping avoid trades that could quickly go wrong. Overall, sentiment features contribute to risk management by acting as an early warning system for news or buzz that could undermine a position. A comprehensive strategy will combine sentiment with other analysis (confirming signals) – sentiment indicators work best alongside technical/fundamental cues

Macroeconomic and Market Context Features
Macroeconomic features capture the broader market and economic environment in which the stock operates. Even the best stock-specific setup can fail if the market is crashing, or a mediocre trade can succeed if the wind (macro trend) is at its back. These features ensure the algorithm’s predictions account for external factors that can influence all stocks:
Broad Market Trend: Indicators for overall market direction, such as the recent performance of major indices (S&P 500, NASDAQ) or an index’s moving average signal (e.g. S&P 500 above/below its 50-day MA). Rationale: Most stocks (especially U.S. stocks) have a positive correlation with the market. If the S&P 500 is in a strong uptrend, long swing trades are more likely to succeed across the board; if the market is in a downtrend or correction, long trades face higher risk. A rule-based filter might require “market trend is positive” to take new long positions. Including market index returns as features also helps the ML model adjust predictions (e.g. expecting lower probability of success for long trades during broad market downturns). This maximizes gains by aligning with bullish periods and minimizes risk by scaling back exposure in bearish conditions.
Market Volatility (VIX): The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), often called the “fear index,” which measures expected near-term volatility for the S&P 500. High VIX values indicate fear and high market risk, while low VIX indicates calmer markets
datahub.io
datahub.io
. Rationale: VIX is a proxy for overall risk appetite. In a swing trading algorithm, VIX can be used to modulate position sizing or signal caution. For instance, if VIX spikes above a threshold, the system might tighten stop-losses or avoid new trades (minimizing risk during turbulent periods). Conversely, very low VIX may signal complacency – some strategies find opportunity in fear spikes (entering trades when others panic, expecting reversion)
datahub.io
. Overall, VIX as a feature helps gauge when to play offense vs. defense. Using VIX to assess market sentiment facilitates better risk assessment and allocation
datahub.io
.
Economic Indicators: Key macroeconomic data such as interest rates (e.g. 10-year Treasury yield), inflation rate (CPI), unemployment rate, GDP growth, and consumer sentiment indices. These data often drive sector rotations and overall market mood
money-mentor.org
. Rationale: While these indicators change on monthly or quarterly timescales, surprises or trends in them can sway markets even in the short term. For example, a sudden rise in yields might hurt high-growth tech stocks (as future earnings are discounted more) – a sector-specific risk. If the algorithm is considering a tech stock trade, a feature for “interest rate trend” could adjust the expectation (higher risk in rising-rate environment). Another example: a strong jobs report might boost consumer discretionary stocks for a few days. Including such features ensures the model accounts for macro currents, maximizing gains by favoring trades aligned with positive economic news and minimizing risk by de-prioritizing trades fighting macro headwinds
money-mentor.org
.
Sector and Industry Momentum: Performance of the stock’s sector ETF or industry index over recent weeks. Also, features like sector-relative strength (how the stock is performing versus its sector). Rationale: Sector momentum often persists for short periods due to thematic trades (e.g. “energy stocks are rising with oil prices”). A swing trade in a stock from a strong sector has better odds (tailwind), whereas a trade in a weak sector is riskier. A hybrid strategy might use a rule like “only long stocks in sectors that are outperforming the S&P 500 in the last month.” The ML model, on its part, can use sector performance as an input to boost predictions for stocks in hot sectors and flag caution for those in slumping ones
medium.com
.
Market Breadth Indicators: Measures of the internal health of the market, such as the Advance/Decline line (number of stocks rising vs falling), percentage of stocks above key moving averages, or new 52-week highs vs lows. Rationale: Strong breadth (many stocks participating in a rally) confirms a robust uptrend – a favorable environment for swing longs. Weak breadth (rallies driven by a few big stocks while most others lag) can warn of an unstable rally that could roll over – increasing risk. By including breadth features, the system can gauge if a price swing in one stock is likely to be supported by broader market strength or if it’s an outlier move. This contributes to risk management (e.g. be wary of long trades when breadth is deteriorating, even if price is still rising).
Currency and Commodity Trends: For certain stocks, macro-level trends in commodities or currencies can be relevant. For example, if trading an oil company, the price of crude oil is a key feature; if trading a multinational exporter, the U.S. dollar index level might matter (a strong dollar can be a headwind). Rationale: These features allow the model to incorporate cross-market influences. A rule-based approach might avoid trades that conflict with commodity trends (e.g. not shorting an energy stock when oil is surging). Including them maximizes gains by capitalizing on obvious macro correlations (oil up + oil stocks up) and minimizes risk by avoiding positions that macro factors are likely to sabotage.
Major Event Flags: A binary feature for impending macro events that could spike volatility: e.g. “FOMC meeting this week”, “Jobs report Friday”, or geopolitical events. Rationale: Such events can whipsaw the entire market. A rule-based component could flat-out avoid holding positions during a known high-risk event (minimizing the chance of an adverse gap). Alternatively, if the strategy is more aggressive, it might use the volatility around events to find entry opportunities after the news. In either case, awareness of the event via a feature is important for risk management.
How macro features aid gains/risk: Macroeconomic context ensures the algorithm is not trading in a vacuum. It contributes to maximizing gains by aligning trades with favorable broader conditions – for instance, going long primarily when the overall market and economic indicators are supportive, which increases the probability of success. It contributes to minimizing risk by signaling caution in rough environments (high volatility, poor breadth, looming Fed decisions) so the strategy can scale back or tighten risk controls. In practice, successful swing trading often means “going with the flow” of the market; macro features measure that flow and allow the strategy to adjust accordingly

Market Structure and Trading Activity Features
Market structure features describe the characteristics of the stock’s trading activity, supply-demand factors, and other attributes not covered by pure price history. These features can highlight the liquidity, positioning, and potential hidden forces that affect how a stock’s price may move. They are crucial for understanding risk (e.g. how easily can we enter/exit, chances of a short squeeze) and for spotting situations of imbalance that could lead to outsized gains:
Liquidity and Volume Profile: Average daily volume, float (number of shares available for trading), and bid-ask spread. Also, metrics like volume at price (if available) or percent of shares held by insiders (reducing effective float). Rationale: A low-float stock with high volume can move very sharply (both up and down). High liquidity stocks (mega-caps) are more stable but may move slower. For swing trading, adequate volume is important so that technical signals are reliable and trades can be executed without large slippage. A feature for bid-ask spread (as a % of price) can indicate trading friction; a wide spread means the stock is less liquid (riskier to trade in size). By filtering out very illiquid stocks (rule-based: e.g. no trades in stocks under $X million daily volume or with tiny floats), one minimizes execution risk. On the flip side, recognizing a stock with just enough float and a surge in volume might indicate a big move brewing (maximize gain potential by being early in a fast-mover).
Market Capitalization & Beta: The stock’s market cap (size of the company) and its beta (historical correlation and volatility relative to the S&P 500). Rationale: Market cap is often related to how a stock behaves – small-cap stocks tend to be more volatile and sensitive to news (higher short-term gain potential but also higher risk of big drops), whereas large-caps are steadier (safer but smaller swings). Beta provides a measure of systematic risk: a high-beta stock will swing more than the market. In a feature set, beta can help the ML model anticipate the magnitude of a swing (high beta implies larger price ranges in a 5–10 day window, which could be good for gain if predicted correctly, but also means higher stop-loss distance needed). A rule-based approach might limit exposure to extremely high-beta names during times of market stress to control risk.
Short Interest and Days-to-Cover: The percentage of float that is sold short, and the short interest ratio (short interest divided by average volume, a.k.a. days to cover)
investopedia.com
. These indicate the presence of bets against the stock and how large they are relative to trading volume
investopedia.com
investopedia.com
. Rationale: High short interest can be a double-edged sword. It often reflects negative sentiment (many expect the price to fall), which is a risk factor. However, it also creates fuel for a short squeeze – if the price starts rising, short sellers may rush to cover, accelerating the upmove
investopedia.com
. In practice, a swing trading algorithm could use short interest features in a contrarian way: a stock with very high short interest might be avoided unless a clear catalyst or breakout is observed – but if a breakout occurs, that trade can be extremely profitable as shorts are forced out. Including this feature helps the model weigh the squeeze potential (maximize gain on explosive moves) versus the risk of why shorts were there (they might know something bad). Reports of short interest allow traders to gauge sentiment and squeeze risk
investopedia.com
investopedia.com
.
Institutional Ownership & Flow: Percentage of shares owned by institutions and recent changes in large holders. Rationale: High institutional ownership could mean the stock is well-researched and maybe more stable (institutions provide support on dips), whereas low institutional ownership might indicate it’s mostly traded by retail (could be more volatile or subject to hype cycles). Also, if there’s news of big hedge funds buying or selling stakes (from 13F filings or news reports), it can influence short-term price (either through increased attention or actual buying pressure). As a feature, a rising institutional ownership trend might be bullish (smart money accumulation), whereas decreasing could be bearish. This contributes to risk management: if institutions are fleeing a stock, a swing trader might think twice despite technical signals.
Order Book or Flow Imbalance Indicators (if available): Metrics like cumulative volume delta (buy vs sell volumes), large block trade detections, or dark pool activity. These are advanced features requiring intraday data. Rationale: Unusual accumulation (persistent large buys) might precede a price breakout. While not typically accessible via Yahoo Finance, some algorithms incorporate such data. For example, a rule might observe that “stealth” buying is occurring (signaled by many large trades hitting the ask) and take a long position in anticipation of a pop. The main benefit here is maximizing gains by catching moves that insiders or large players are starting, and minimizing risk by ensuring the algorithm isn’t trading against a hidden tide of selling.
Historical Trading Range Position: The stock’s current price relative to its recent range – e.g. percentage off 52-week high/low, or percentile in the past 3-month range. Rationale: This indicates if the stock is near multiyear highs, lows, or mid-range. A stock at 52-week highs may have momentum but also no nearby resistance (could run further, good for momentum trades), whereas a stock at highs might also be overextended (risk of pullback). A stock near lows might be out of favor (risky) unless there’s a catalyst, or it could be a value pick ready for a bounce. Including range position as a feature helps the ML model factor in mean reversion potential vs. breakout potential. For risk: a rule might avoid shorting a stock at 52-week lows (since risk/reward might favor a bounce) or avoid buying at 52-week highs without confirmation. In contrast, if a stock breaks to a new high on volume (feature combination: near high + volume spike), that’s often a powerful bullish signal.
Support/Resistance from Market Profile: (If data available) Price levels that had high volume in the past (volume profile) or where lots of trades executed (visible in level 2 historically). Rationale: These are potential support/resistance from a market structure perspective. The algorithm could include features like “distance to nearest major support level” or “volume traded at current price level vs average”. This is somewhat specialized, but it complements classical support/resistance by quantifying where trading interest lies. It helps in setting profit targets (maximize realized gain by selling just before a big known supply level) and stops (place stops just beyond high-volume support to minimize chances of whipsaw).
How market structure features aid gains/risk: These features make the strategy aware of the environment in which it’s trading. For example, knowing that a stock has low float and high short interest tells the algorithm that if a rally starts, it could accelerate dramatically (huge gain potential) – but it also implies the stock is volatile and risky. By accounting for that, the model might demand a higher confidence to trade it or adjust the position size (risk mitigation). Market structure elements like volume and liquidity ensure practical viability – a predicted “great trade” is not great if you can’t get in or out easily, so the rules might filter for minimum liquidity to protect the trader. In sum, market structure features maximize gains by identifying special situations (short squeezes, breakouts in low-float stocks, etc.) and minimize risk by avoiding pitfalls (illiquid stocks, crowded shorts without catalyst, etc.). They complement technical signals with an understanding of who is trading and how the trading might unfold.
Alternative Data Sources and Additional Features
Beyond traditional market and fundamental data, various alternative data sources can enrich the feature set. These can provide unique angles and early signals, further improving prediction of swing trade success:
Insider Trading Activity: As mentioned, tracking insider buys/sells from SEC filings (Form 4). In particular, insider cluster buys (multiple insiders buying in a short period) are a powerful bullish signal
nasdaq.com
. Such data could be sourced from services that aggregate insider trades. Rationale: Insiders often buy because they expect good news or undervaluation, so their activity can foreshadow a swing up. Conversely, heavy insider selling might precede a downturn. Incorporating this helps capture moves that aren’t obvious from technicals alone. (Example use: A rule-based filter might prioritize stocks with recent insider buying, and the ML model might include the number of insider shares bought in the last month as a feature.)
Social Media and Web Trends: Data like Google Search Trends for the company name or ticker, Wikipedia page hits, or Twitter trending metrics. Rationale: A sudden rise in search volume or social media mentions can indicate growing interest that might lead to price momentum. These are alternative sentiment measures; unlike sentiment score, which measures tone, these measure attention. More attention often equals more liquidity and volatility (and opportunity). For instance, if significantly more people are Googling a small company, perhaps news is spreading that could drive the stock up – a useful early indicator to maximize gains by getting in before the crowd fully piles on.
News Volume and Unusual News Flow: Not just what the news says (sentiment) but how much news there is. A feature could be the count of news articles in the past 3 days relative to norm. Rationale: An explosion of news coverage (even if neutral) puts a stock on traders’ radar, which can lead to swings. Alternatively, a normally news-sparse stock suddenly having several articles might mean something material changed. Including news frequency can alert the model to heightened activity around the stock.
Alternative Fundamental Metrics: These could include things like web traffic data for the company’s website, app download rankings (for tech companies), credit card transaction trends (for retailers), satellite imagery (store parking lot traffic, etc.). Such data often require specialized sources. Rationale: If available, these can give a real-time fundamental pulse. For example, rising app downloads could predict strong earnings or user growth news – a catalyst for a swing rally. While not traditional, they can enhance the model’s ability to predict a swing before official numbers come out. (These are more optional due to access difficulty, but worth mentioning.)
Environmental, Social, Governance (ESG) and News Sentiment: ESG scores or controversy indicators. Rationale: A sudden controversy (social or environmental issue) can cause a stock to drop quickly. Conversely, being added to a sustainability index or receiving positive press for governance might give a short-term boost. These are niche, but if the strategy wants to avoid tail-risk, it might incorporate a flag for companies facing serious controversy (to avoid longs there until it subsides).
Unusual Options Activity: Data on options trades, such as big blocks of calls or puts bought, or the implied volatility term structure. Some third-party platforms flag when a stock has much higher options volume than usual or big trades (possibly by informed investors). Rationale: Unusual call buying might signal expectations of a sharp rise (insiders or smart money positioning), which could precede a stock move. It’s an alternative angle on sentiment and positioning. A feature could be something like “options volume vs avg” or a dummy if any single large bullish option trade occurred recently. Incorporating this could allow the algorithm to catch swings signaled by the options market.
Cross-Asset or Macro Indicators: For example, if trading a gold miner stock, alternative data could be the physical gold ETF flows; for a tech stock, maybe cryptocurrency prices if it’s related (just as an idea). Rationale: Sometimes, assets in related domains move together. If one has data on those, they can improve predictions for the stock (this is highly case-dependent and more of a specialized augmentation).
Optional nature of alt data: These alternative features can further enhance predictions, but they might require specialized data sources beyond Yahoo Finance. They are useful for gaining an edge. For instance, insider purchases are not captured in price data yet can predict future outperformance
nasdaq.com
nasdaq.com
. Social sentiment from Reddit might explain a sudden rally that baffled pure fundamentalists. The inclusion of such data makes the model more robust to different catalysts. However, they should complement, not replace, the core technical/fundamental/sentiment features. In a hybrid strategy, alternative data might be used as additional filters or alerts (e.g. a rule could be “if insider buying cluster detected, increase the score of that trade”). These sources underscore a quantamental approach: blending traditional analysis with diverse data for optimal results

Combining Features in a Hybrid Rule-Based + ML Strategy
Designing a swing trading algorithm with both rule-based logic and machine learning involves orchestrating these features in a sensible way. The goal is to leverage human expertise and clear rules to filter and manage risk, while using ML to find complex patterns and score trade opportunities
nomuraconnects.com
. Here’s how the combination can work:
Rule-Based Screening and Filters (Human-Defined Rules): First, apply a set of hard rules to whittle down the universe of stocks and signals. These rules reflect known best practices and risk constraints. For example:
Technical rule filters: Require that the stock is in an uptrend (e.g. price above a certain moving average or making higher highs) and has sufficient volume. One might only consider stocks that recently pulled back to a support level and are showing a technical rebound signal (this ensures a favorable entry point).
Fundamental rule filters: Filter out companies with red flags (e.g. extremely high debt, or an upcoming earnings report in the next few days if we want to avoid event risk). Perhaps only trade stocks that have “acceptable” valuation ranges or positive earnings growth, as these tend to be more stable for swing moves

.
Sentiment/news rules: Exclude stocks that have extremely negative news or an ongoing scandal (to avoid catching a falling knife). Or conversely, flag stocks with a recent surge in positive news or insider buying as eligible candidates.
Macro/market rules: If the overall market trend is very negative (confirmed downtrend), the rule-based system might restrict taking new long positions (since the probability of success drops in bear moves). Similarly, it could limit position size or require stronger technical signals during high-volatility periods (high VIX)

These rule-based filters ensure that the algorithm focuses on high-probability setups and respects risk from the outset. They act as a first line of defense to minimize risk, rooted in trading wisdom and domain knowledge (for example, confirming technical and fundamental alignment before a trade

). By narrowing the search space, they also make the ML model’s job easier, as it will score only reasonable candidates.
Feature Engineering & ML Model Scoring: Once candidates pass the rule filters, a machine learning model evaluates them using the full spectrum of features described earlier. The ML model could be a classifier (predicting probability of a successful swing trade or an expected return) or a ranking model. It looks at complex interactions: for instance, how a combination of mild insider buying + a slight increase in short interest + strong sector momentum + a bullish RSI divergence might together predict an outsized move. ML can detect nonlinear patterns and subtle signals that fixed rules might miss

. Each candidate trade gets a score or predicted outcome from the model. Importantly, the ML doesn’t operate in isolation – it’s informed by robust features that span technical, fundamental, sentiment, etc. This quantamental approach “harnesses the power of machines and combines it with the application of human skills” for better decisions

. The model might, for example, assign higher scores to stocks where multiple categories align (technical breakout + positive news sentiment + low valuation). By using ML, we aim to maximize gains: the model may discover profitable setups that are not obvious, and rank the opportunities so we pick the best of the best.
Decision Logic and Trade Execution: The final step combines rule outputs and ML scores into actual trading decisions:
The highest-scoring trades (those the ML deems most likely to succeed) are selected, provided they meet all the rule-based criteria. For example, if a stock has a great ML score but a rule was to avoid stocks near earnings, the system will skip it to stay within risk appetite.
The rules can also incorporate position sizing: e.g. risk manager rules might say “if volatility (ATR or VIX) is high, halve the position size” or “if the ML confidence is only moderate, take a smaller position.” This ensures the algorithm doesn’t over-allocate to trades with higher uncertainty.
Risk management rules remain in effect throughout: stop-loss levels can be set based on technical levels or volatility (ATR), and profit targets can be set based on resistance levels or reward/risk ratios. The ML’s prediction can be used to inform these (like expected move size can guide setting a profit target).
The Risk Manager function (which can be seen as part of rule-based logic) acts as a gatekeeper that checks the ML-selected trades against risk thresholds

. For instance, it might calculate the worst-case loss if all open trades go wrong (Value at Risk) and block new trades if risk is too high

. This ensures that even if the ML is enthusiastic about many trades, the system doesn’t take on excessive aggregate risk.
Feedback and Adaptation: Over time, the performance data (which trades were winners/losers) can be fed back. The ML model can retrain on new data to improve its predictive power as market conditions change. Meanwhile, the rule set can be tweaked by human developers as we learn – for example, if the ML consistently flags trades that are filtered out by a certain rule but would have been profitable, we might loosen that rule. Conversely, if a rule allowed some poor trades through, it might be tightened. This ongoing refinement is part of the hybrid approach’s strength: it balances model learning with human insight.
In summary, the hybrid strategy works as follows: the rules define the playing field and enforce crucial risk/reward prerequisites, and the ML model plays within that field to pick the most promising opportunities
