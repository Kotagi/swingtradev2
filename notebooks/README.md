# Notebooks Directory

This directory contains research notebooks, historical documentation, and reference materials for the SwingTradeV2 project.

## Directory Structure

```
notebooks/
├── archive/          # Historical documentation and old roadmaps
├── research/         # Active research notes and checklists
└── README.md         # This file
```

## Organization

### `archive/`
Contains historical documentation that is no longer actively used but kept for reference:
- Old roadmaps and planning documents
- Historical feature guides
- Previous project documentation

### `research/`
Contains active research materials and working notes:
- Feature checklists
- Parameter search results
- Research notes and experiments

## Guidelines

- **Archive**: Move files here when they are no longer actively referenced but may be useful for historical context
- **Research**: Place active research notes, checklists, and experimental results here
- **Logs**: Log files should go to `outputs/logs/` (not in notebooks)

## Notes

- This directory is for reference materials only
- Active development code should be in `src/`
- Test scripts should be in `tests/`
- Output files should be in `outputs/`
